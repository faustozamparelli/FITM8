# FITM8 - HCI Project

the app idea is a dating app where you can match based on common sports hobbies based on skill or diet preferences so that on the first date you can do sports together or go eat something that you both enjoy

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Team and responsibilities

Needfinding: Fausto

Storyboarding: Chiara

Paper ProtoTyping: Beksultan

Digital ProtoTyping: Melvis + Daniele

Coded Prototype: Daniel

## Human-Centered Design Process

The procedure we were inspired to create the digital prototype is the Human-Centered Design Process:

1. **Needfinding and Analysis**
   - What exactly is needed? How are people currently accomplishing the goal?
   - User observation, interviews, questionnaire
   - Formalize and structure the needs
   - Create interaction scenarios, stories, tasks
   - Compare current situation with expected new situation
2. **Design, Iteration, and Prototyping**
   - Rules, guidelines, design principles
   - Modeling and describing interaction
   - Visual layout
   - Consider all inputs from cognitive models, communications theories, organization issues
   - Design must be supported by intermediate verification
   - Evaluate the design in its partial forms: Prototypes and Evaluation metrics
   - Involving users
3. **Implementation and deployment**
   - Hardware and software implementation
   - Documentation
