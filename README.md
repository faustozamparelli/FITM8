## Human-Centered Design Process

The procedure we were inspired to create the digital prototype is the Human-Centered Design Process:

1. **Needfinding**
   - What exactly is needed? How are people currently accomplishing the goal?
   - User observation, interviews, questionnaire
2. **Analysis**
   - Formalize and structure the needs
   - Create interaction scenarios, stories, tasks
   - Compare current situation with expected new situation
3. **Design**
   - Rules, guidelines, design principles
   - Modeling and describing interaction
   - Visual layout
   - Consider all inputs from cognitive models, communications theories, organization issues
4. **Iteration and prototyping**
   - Design must be supported by intermediate verification
   - Evaluate the design in its partial forms: Prototypes and Evaluation metrics
   - Involving users
5. **Implementation and deployment**
   - Hardware and software implementation
   - Documentation
